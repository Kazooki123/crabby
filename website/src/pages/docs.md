# Introduction

**Welcome to the world of Crabby**, a revolutionary programming language made entirely in the **Zig language**, designed to meet the demands of the modern programming era. Crabby is not just another language; it's a paradigm shift that aims to redefine the way we approach programming.

Note: Crabby **isn't a fully functional** programming language yet. So that's why we need you to help us create crabby. I'm also trying to create the download website for Crabby Which will be released sooner.

## Features

- Crabby designed for simplicity.
- Easy to learn and understand.
- Ideal for beginners.
- Powerful for handling complex tasks.
- Suitable for experienced developers too.

## Example

This is an example of a **hello world** program

```python
hello.cb ("cb" short for crabby)
```

### hello.cb

```python
output.print("Hello World");
```
