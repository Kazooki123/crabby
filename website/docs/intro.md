# Introduction

**Welcome to the world of Crabby**, a revolutionary programming language made entirely in the **Zig language**, designed to meet the demands of the modern programming era. Crabby is not just another language; it's a paradigm shift that aims to redefine the way we approach programming.

Note: Crabby **isn't a fully functional** programming language yet. So that's why we need you to help us create crabby. I'm also trying to create the download website for Crabby Which will be released sooner.

## Getting Started


### What you'll need

- Esse sit consequat amet sunt veniam ipsum dolor.
  - Anim adipisicing incididunt pariatur minim elit laboris minim fugiat eu incididunt ad labore laborum irure.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
hello.cb ("cb" short for crabby)
```
