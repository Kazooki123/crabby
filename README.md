## Introduction

![Logo](https://github.com/Kazooki123/crabby/blob/main/examples/crabbylogo.jpg)

Welcome to the world of Crabby, a revolutionary programming language made entirely in the **Zig** language, designed to meet the demands of the modern programming era. Crabby is not just another language; it's a paradigm shift that aims to redefine the way we approach programming.

## Note

Crabby isn't a fully functional programming language yet. So that's why we need you to help us create crabby. I'm also trying to create the download website for Crabbyü¶Ä Which will be released sooner.

## Features

### Simplicity

Crabby is designed with simplicity in mind. It's easy to learn and understand, making it perfect for beginners. Yet, it's powerful enough to handle complex tasks, making it a great choice for experienced developers as well.

### Efficiency

Crabby is built for speed. It's optimized for performance, ensuring that your programs run as fast as possible. With Crabby, you can focus on writing great code, knowing that it will be executed efficiently.

### Versatility

Crabby is a versatile language. It supports multiple programming paradigms, allowing you to choose the best approach for each task. Whether you prefer procedural, object-oriented, or functional programming, Crabby has you covered.

## Examples

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Crabby:

```crabby
// hello.cb ("cb" short for crabby)
output.print("Hello, World!");
```

### Notes

output.print = Is the syntax for printing the hello world.
